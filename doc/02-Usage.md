## Settings

**ServiceNow API URL:** The base url to your ServiceNow instance. (e.g. `https://instance0815.service-now.com`)

**ServiceNow CMDB Table Endpoint:**  The API endpoint to fetch objects from. An official list of available tables can be found [here](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/yokohama-servicenow-platform/page/product/configuration-management/reference/cmdb-tables-details.html?state=seamless).  
Since we wanted to make it as customizable as possible, we don't have a hardcoded api method. Therefore, you have to provide the full endpoint for the table here (e.g. `api/now/table/cmdb_ci_server`).

**ServiceNow API Username:** User to authenticate against the ServiceNow API. This user needs to have read access to the table you want to import.

**ServiceNow API Password:** Password to authenticate against the ServiceNow API.

**ServiceNow API Timeout:** Timeout for the API request in seconds. Default is `20` seconds.

**ServiceNow Columns:** Per default, we fetch all available columns. In case you want to limit the columns, you can provide a comma separated list of columns here. (e.g. `name,ip_address`)

**ServiceNow Query:**  Per default, no filter limitation is applied to the query. The whole table will be fetched. In case you want to limit the objects, you can provide a filter query here.  
To filter, you will need to follow the [official filter syntax from ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/yokohama-platform-user-interface/page/use/using-lists/concept/c_EncodedQueryStrings.html) An example could be `nameSTARTSWITHlnux`.
